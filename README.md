# Dynamic-to-Static-IP-Address
Demo of how to solve the problem of assigning the static IP address to ec2 instance as every time you stop or start the instance the IP address gets changed.
Also never forget to stop the instance after it has been used or not in use.
Stop it if you have to use it again otherwise just terminate it for best practices.
